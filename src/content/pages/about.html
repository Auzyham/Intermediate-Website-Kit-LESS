            <p class="cs-text">
                Hello! I am Austin, a dedicated husband, father to two beautiful daughters, avid climber, coffee drinker, and a certified personal trainer.
My journey into fitness started during my childhood, where personal discomfort spurred a commitment to uncovering a healthier way of living. This dedication has fueled my life's purpose â€“ assisting others in realizing their full potential.
Over time, my training philosophy has evolved from heavy lifting to encompass a spectrum of fluid and functional movements, ensuring a comprehensive and tailored approach.
In 2020, I attained certification from the National Academy of Sports Medicine (NASM), fortifying my commitment to the growth of others and contributing to the community.  I know how confusing and hard it can be to start to reach your goals. 
I am here to provide a supportive platform for your fitness journey. Let us embark on a path that aligns with your goals, employing strategic methodologies for sustainable and transformative results.
